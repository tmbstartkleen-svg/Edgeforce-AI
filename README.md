## Current build — V35 Event-Level Joint Simulation + Learned SGP Correlation

V35 stops treating same-event parlay legs as independent outcomes. It combines a shared event-level Gaussian-copula simulation with conservative historical correlation learning from settled same-event wager legs.

### V35 joint simulation
- 10,000 correlated simulations for standard 2–3 leg parlays
- tapered simulation counts for larger 4–20 leg probability sets to control browser/runtime cost
- one joint probability for the entire parlay
- independent probability retained for direct comparison
- 95% Monte Carlo interval retained
- same-event pair correlation matrix with automatic positive-definite shrinkage
- cross-event legs remain independent inside the joint engine
- same event name on different start times is not treated as the same game

### Learned SGP correlation
- settled same-event leg pairs feed market-pair profiles
- Over/Under direction is preserved in the learned market signature
- phi correlation, joint lift, sample size and confidence are persisted
- minimum sample default: 20 settled pairs
- shrinkage default: 50 samples
- small samples remain neutral
- learned rho is capped to avoid unstable historical overfitting
- heuristic and learned correlation are blended by historical confidence
- active profiles rebuild with the daily recalibration workflow

### APIs
- `GET /api/intelligence/sgp-correlation` — active learned profiles
- `POST /api/intelligence/sgp-correlation` — correlated joint simulation for supplied legs
- `PUT /api/intelligence/sgp-correlation` — authenticated correlation-profile rebuild
- `GET /api/testing/joint-simulation` — deterministic positive/negative correlation guardrail when test endpoints are enabled

### Release identity
- build: `V35`
- app: `35.0.0`
- package: `0.35.0`
- model: `edgeforce-v35`
- migration: `v34`

### Guardrails
- Learned SGP relationships require minimum settled sample size before affecting probability.
- Correlation profiles are shrinkage-weighted and capped.
- Non-positive-definite correlation matrices are automatically shrunk toward independence.
- Public joint-simulation requests are capped at 10,000 runs; authenticated requests can use up to 100,000.
- Same-game correlation and simulation probabilities are estimates, not guarantees.

## V34 Distribution-Aware Prediction Intelligence

V34 upgrades the simulation layer from mostly generic normal-style outputs to market-specific probability distributions with explicit uncertainty ranges.

### V34 distribution families
- Bernoulli for binary event markets when represented as probability outcomes
- Poisson for ordinary count statistics
- negative binomial for overdispersed count statistics
- gamma for positive-skew yardage and similar continuous props
- lognormal for strictly positive skewed duration/distance-type statistics
- normal for high-volume continuous statistics

### Team simulation upgrades
- MLB, NHL and soccer now use discrete score simulation rather than continuous score draws
- higher-scoring team sports retain continuous score models
- team simulation now returns p10, p50 and p90 outcome ranges

### Player prop upgrades
- provider projection mean and standard deviation determine the market distribution when available
- distribution selection is market/stat aware
- p10, p50 and p90 simulated ranges are retained
- distribution confidence is retained separately from model confidence
- availability and non-starter adjustments remain active

### Auditability
- each model run can retain distribution family
- distribution confidence
- p10 / p50 / p90 quantiles
- simulation engine and projection
- player context and sport context

### Release identity
- build: `V34.1`
- app: `34.1.0`
- package: `0.34.1`
- model: `edgeforce-v34`
- migration: `v33`

### Elite roadmap remaining after V35
- V36: sport-specific possession/play/plate-appearance/shift engines
- V37: multi-provider consensus pricing and sharp-vs-public market structure
- V38: regime detection, uncertainty calibration and dynamic confidence
- V39: portfolio optimization with scenario stress testing and drawdown control
- V40: explainability, model diagnostics, ablation and live what-if analysis
- V41: final data-quality, automation, deployment, security and production hardening

### Guardrails
- Distribution choice is a modeling assumption and is labeled in output.
- Missing projection inputs are not fabricated.
- Simulated ranges and probabilities are estimates, not guarantees.
- Market movement, CLV and historical performance do not guarantee future results.
